                    <p>When I was in secondary school, I’m a “Mathcore” where I love reasoning and logic. To me maths is a tool to solve problem, so as it’s siblings programming which shows the same trait. I never know programming until my friend told me few years ago, as I got tired from working in accounting line, I find no reason for not try programming as internet is flooded with tutorial, guides and examples that teaches me to become a programmer.</p>
